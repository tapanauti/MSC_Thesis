The earliest research can be found around the 1940s and the majority of the Research that emerged over Neural Network and its application 
can be found after the 1980s. From then to the present, there have
been significant changes in the applications and use of Neural Network
and the concepts of Deep Learning. Many kinds of research emerged
in all the fields about machines showing cognitive abilities, which is
not new. The capabilities of performing human tasks and cognitive
thinking shown by machines is what debatably AI can achieve and
researches in. Over the years the research gave rise to new concepts
of reproducing various activities performed by humans, one such being
Music.
The concept of music reproduction with the help of deep learning
is as well not new, but what is new is the quality of regeneration,
its similarities to original work, and also the uniqueness of melodies
generated. We can say the machine truly learned and performed,
along with all these things one crucial thing that is also new in todayâ€™s
research is the availability of resources. This thesis has tried to achieve
one similar thing where I have tried to reproduce Irish traditional folk
music.
Generative Adversarial Network model has been proposed for the generation
where Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) will be used as the
generator and as the discriminator. ABC files have been used to train
the model for music generation. This thesis aims to generate tunes
that will be similar to Irish Folk Music with a model that is not specifically
tuned for Irish Folk but can later be used on any type of music
and generate similar tunes.
